# Command Line Interface Guidelines (CLI Guidelines)

## Overview

### UX Goal

Creating New Customers

### Effort

The goal is to enhance ROSA CLI usability, following industry-standard conventions like verb-noun structure, providing a seamless and intuitive experience for users in managing Red Hat OpenShift clusters.

### Desired User Outcomes

The purpose of these guidelines is to assist in creating a consistent experience for our users across Red Hat. In doing that we must ensure our teams are on the same page when adding and creating features for our CLI. The motivation behind this is to document a set of guidelines for ROSA and OCM CLIs.

### How This Effort Impacts the Goal

Well-documented, user-friendly CLI tools increase the likelihood of attracting and retaining ROSA customers, as they can readily and confidently manage their infrastructure, reducing the appeal of other options.

### Measuring the Effort

## Naming Conventions

- **Verb-noun structure** command structure (aligns with kubectl)

    - **Verb**: Represents the action or operation that the command performs.
    - **Noun**: Indicates the target or object on which the action is performed.

### Examples

Here, the command follows a clear Verb-Noun structure. 'Create' represents the action, and 'cluster' signifies the target object.
